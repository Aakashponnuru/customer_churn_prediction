# customer_churn_prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn. The goal is to identify customers likely to discontinue services, helping businesses take proactive measures to retain them.


# Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature selection and encoding
Model training using classification algorithms
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Insights and visualization

# Dataset
The dataset includes customer-level information such as:
Demographics (e.g., gender, age)
Account information (e.g., tenure, contract type)
Services used (e.g., internet, streaming)
Payment method and charges
Churn label (Yes/No)
Note: Ensure the dataset is available in the same directory or modify the notebook path accordingly.

# Requirements
Install dependencies with:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install major packages individually:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
Open the notebook:
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Customer_churn_prediction.ipynb
# Results
The model demonstrates good performance in identifying churn cases and can be used as a baseline for future improvements. Metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix are presented in the notebook.

# Future Work
Hyperparameter tuning

Model deployment (e.g., with Flask or FastAPI)

Feature engineering enhancements

Integration with real-time dashboards
